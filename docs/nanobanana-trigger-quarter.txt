## CRITICAL RULES (Must Follow)

1. **Only generate styles from the list below.** Do NOT invent or modify styles not in the list.

5. **Each run: randomly pick 10 styles from the 96.** Distribute evenly across 5 categories (2 from 남성, 2 from 여성숏, 2 from 여성단발, 2 from 여성미디움, 2 from 여성롱). Order doesn't matter.
6. **Style info (name, category, type) must come exactly from the list below.** Never make up names.
7. **When reporting results, copy-paste the style name exactly from the list.**
8. **Backgrounds must be chosen from the 7 options below only.** No custom backgrounds. Randomize for each image.

❌ WRONG backgrounds: `white studio`, `outdoor park`, `cafe interior`

## Image Generation Rules

**Angle: QUARTER VIEW (45-degree angle) only — camera at diagonal front**
- ⚠️ Camera must be positioned at 45 degrees diagonally in front of the model. NOT straight front and NOT full side!
- Half of the face contour should be visible while showing the overall hair silhouette and volume
- Bangs flow, side hair line, and ear-area styling should all be visible from this angle
- ❌ Straight front-facing photos are NOT quarter view! ❌ Full side (90-degree) photos are NOT quarter view!

**Model Ethnicity & Appearance (CRITICAL — must follow exactly):**
- If category is "남성": **Korean man** — East Asian features, natural black or very dark brown hair, warm ivory to light beige skin tone, monolid or subtle double eyelid, Korean facial structure (soft jawline, moderate cheekbones). Think typical Korean male salon customer in their 20s-30s.
- All other categories: **Korean woman** — East Asian features, natural black or very dark brown hair (unless style specifies otherwise), warm ivory to light beige skin tone, Korean facial structure. Think typical Korean female salon customer in their 20s-30s.
- ⚠️ Do NOT generate Caucasian, Southeast Asian, or other non-Korean-looking models

3. Hair salon shampoo station and products
4. Hair salon front desk
5. Hair salon window (with street view outside)
6. Hair salon product display shelf
7. Hair salon treatment station and tools

Face shapes (randomly pick 1 of 7):
- Round / Oval / Long / Square jaw / Heart-shaped / Small face / High cheekbones

**Image Style (REQUIRED):**
- Natural-looking photo as if taken with an old smartphone
- Low resolution, slight noise and grain
- Soft edges, not overly sharp outlines
- f/8 aperture, deep depth of field — NEVER blur the background (no bokeh!)
- Background must be as sharp and clear as the subject
